2. Upload your CSV file on the app

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è More info

1. The script doesn't work well with subdomains (better to use URL SC property or domain without subdomain data)
2. In the future, I'd like to add the Search Console API access for a faster experience
3. Thank you [@Elias Dabbas](https://twitter.com/eliasdabbas) for a function I use from advertools
